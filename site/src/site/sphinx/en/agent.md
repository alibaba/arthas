Start as a Java Agent
====

Usually Arthas dynamic attach the applications on the fly, but from version `3.2.0` onwards, Arthas supports starting directly as a java agent.

For example, download the full arthas zip package, decompress it and start it by specifying `arthas-agent.jar` with the parameter `-javaagent`.

````
java -javaagent:/tmp/test/arthas-agent.jar -jar arthas-demo.jar
````

The default configuration is in the `arthas.properties` file in the decompression directory.
