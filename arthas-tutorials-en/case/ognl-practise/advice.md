There is a very fundamental class [Advice](https://arthas.aliyun.com/doc/advice-class.html) for the expressions used in filtering, tracing or monitoring and other aspects in commands.
For example, common commands like `watch`{{}} , `trace`{{}} , `tt`{{}} , `ognl`{{}} , and `vmtool`{{}} are all based on OGNL expressions.

`watch com.example.demo.arthas.user.UserController  * "{loader, clazz, method, target, params, returnObj, throwExp, isBefore, isThrow, isReturn}"`{{exec}}

After running the above command, access [/user/1]({{TRAFFIC_HOST1_80}}/user/1) you can see the output of the corresponding variables.

The user can exit the watch command by typing `Q`{{exec interrupt}} or `Ctrl+C`{{exec interrupt}}.
