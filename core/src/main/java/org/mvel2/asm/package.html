Provides a small and fast bytecode manipulation framework.

<p>
    The <a href="http://asm.ow2.org/">ASM</a> framework is organized
    around the {@link org.mvel2.asm.ClassVisitor ClassVisitor},
    {@link org.mvel2.asm.FieldVisitor FieldVisitor},
    {@link org.mvel2.asm.MethodVisitor MethodVisitor} and
    {@link org.mvel2.asm.AnnotationVisitor AnnotationVisitor} abstract classes,
    which allow one to visit the fields, methods and annotations of a class,
    including the bytecode instructions of each method.

<p>
    In addition to these main abstract classes, ASM provides a {@link
    org.mvel2.asm.ClassReader ClassReader} class, that can parse an
    existing class and make a given visitor visit it. ASM also provides
    a {@link org.mvel2.asm.ClassWriter ClassWriter} class, which is
    a visitor that generates Java class files.

<p>
    In order to generate a class from scratch, only the {@link
    org.mvel2.asm.ClassWriter ClassWriter} class is necessary. Indeed,
    in order to generate a class, one must just call its visit<i>Xxx</i>
    methods with the appropriate arguments to generate the desired fields
    and methods.

<p>
    In order to modify existing classes, one must use a {@link
    org.mvel2.asm.ClassReader ClassReader} class to analyze
    the original class, a class modifier, and a {@link org.mvel2.asm.ClassWriter
    ClassWriter} to construct the modified class. The class modifier
    is just a {@link org.mvel2.asm.ClassVisitor ClassVisitor}
    that delegates most of the work to another {@link org.mvel2.asm.ClassVisitor
    ClassVisitor}, but that sometimes changes some parameter values,
    or call additional methods, in order to implement the desired
    modification process. In order to make it easier to implement such
    class modifiers, the {@link org.mvel2.asm.ClassVisitor
    ClassVisitor} and {@link org.mvel2.asm.MethodVisitor MethodVisitor}
    classes delegate by default all the method calls they receive to an
    optional visitor.
