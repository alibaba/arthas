If you want to execute the previous command again, you can match the previous command by pressing `Up/↑` or `Ddown/↓` when you enter halfway.

For example, if `sysprop java.version` was executed before, then after entering `sysprop ja`, you can type `Up/↑`, and it will be automatically completed as `sysprop java.version`.

If you want to see all the history commands, you can also view them with the `history`{{execute T2}} command.
